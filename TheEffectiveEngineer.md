## Highlights

### Chapter 1: Focus on high-leverage activities
(pg.18)
- Use leverage to measure your engineering effectiveness
  - Focus on what generates the highest return on investment for your time spent.
- Systematically increase the leverage of your time.
  - Find ways to get an activity done more quickly, to increase the impact of an activity, or to shift to activities with higher leverage.
- Focus your effort on leverage points.
  - Time is your most limited asset. Identify the habits that produce disproportionately high impact for the time you invest.


### Chapter 2: Optimise for learning
(pg.23)
- Those with growth mindsets are willing to take steps to better themselves, whereas those with fixed mindsets are not.


### Chapter 3: Prioritize regularly
(pg.42-43)
- Regular prioritization is a high-leverage activity, because it determines the leverage of the rest of your time.
- [those who follow checklists] eliminate large classes of avoidable errors simply by writing steps down and tracking what needs to be done.

(pg.44-45)
- the human brain is optimized for processing and not for storage.
- The goal isn't to establish a total ordering of all your priorities, since any ordering you make will be based on imperfect information; instead, it's to continuously shift your top priorities toward the ones with the highest leverage, given the information you have.

(pg.46-47)
- When you get important things right, the small things often don't matter.
- After you ship a change that produces value, find the next task that will produce value. Prioritise the ones that produce the most value with the least amount of effort. Once you do this a few times, it becomes easier to recognise which tasks are the most valuable.
- Don't treat every invitation to do something as an obligation. Explain how the meeting, bug, or project will detract from your other tasks, and discuss whether it should have higher priority. If not, you probably shouldn't be spending your time on it. Don't try to get everything done. Focus on what matters - and what matters is what produces value.

(pg.49)
- Be wary if you're spending too much time on important and urgent activities. A high-priority bug or a pressing deadline for a project may be important and urgent, but assess whether you're simply addressing the symptoms of the problem and not its underlying cause. Oftentimes, the root cause is an underinvestment in a non-urgent important activity.
- Investing in non-urgent important activities can reduce urgent tasks and their associated causes.

(pg.50)
- Engineers needs longer and more contiguous blocks of time to be productive than many other professionals.
